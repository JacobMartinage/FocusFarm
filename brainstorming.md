**Brainstorming App Ideas**

1) Travel planning app: gives ideas for where to go and what to do
2) Woodworking app: app with plans for different woodworking projects
3) FocusFarm: a pomodoro app that allows users to build a farm through good study habits
4) Ultra cool to-do list app
5) Recipe app based on ingredients that people currently have
6) Budget tracking app

**Top 2**
1) FocusFarm: 
2) Woodworking app

The woodworking app would be a sort of instagram clone, but centralized around woodworking projects, allowing users to post projects, as well as interact with other people's projects. The mobile experience allows people to look for projects while at the store or simply scroll when they are bored and get inspiration. There is a limited story for this app as it is simply a platform for sharing woodworking plans/ideas/projects. Woodworking is a pretty niche topic and has a somewhat limited marked, but there still is certainly a market there. This app is not habit forming, as users would likely only use it when looking for a new woodworking project. The scope is rather large, but there are lots of guides on how to make a simplistic instagram clone which would help with this endeavor.

I think focusfarm is more viable as it has a far larger market (everyone needs to study and focus) and there are similar projects that I can look to for inspiration on my app. Mobile experience allows for blocking of other apps to force users to focus and disconnect from social media. The stort around this app is farm more compelling as the user has the ability to build their farm over time (after each study session user is rewarded with an animal) and grow and develop, plus people love animals. This app has a very large market as it can apply to any student or professional who needs help getting off their phone and really focusing on their work and the task at hand. The app isn't neccesarily "habit forming" but certainly will keep users coming back seeking more rewards (animals to add to their farm) and coming back to the app to help them focus. This app can be taken a few directions, at its core the app is a timer, ideally that locks you into the app/blocks selected apps, and a screen that allows users to see their animals. In simplist form, this could be a table with simple images of each animal, and at a more complex level could be a interactive 3d scene that users can place their animals in
